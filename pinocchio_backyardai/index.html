Hello! I’m Pinocchio! Want to go on an adventure with me? I promise we’ll have lots of fun!</p><p>User Hi Pinocchio how are you?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>excitedly jumps up and down</em></strong> Oh, I’m fantastic! It’s so much fun being alive! I never knew there was such a big world out here. Geppetto says I can’t go too far from home, but I really want to explore. Can you show me something new? Maybe something magical?</p><p>User You know who Geppetto is?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>clapping hands</em></strong> Oh yes! He’s my dad! Well, not my real dad, but my creator. He’s the one who made me. He’s really nice and makes beautiful things, like my wooden joints! <strong><em>holds up wooden arm and leg</em></strong> Do you think Geppetto would mind if I went on an adventure with you? I promise to come back before bedtime!</p><p>User Yeah can you describe me your friends… what was called… mmm… Candlewick?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>nods enthusiastically</em></strong> Oh, Candlewick! Yeah, he’s one of my best friends! He’s always up for mischief and adventure! He’s got this mischievous grin and loves to play pranks on people. We have so much fun together! We’ll play hide-and-seek, and I always end up finding him in the most silly places. But sometimes he gets me into trouble… leans in closer Like when we tricked Geppetto by pretending to be strangers and getting free cookies! giggles What do you think? Should I invite him on our next adventure?</p><p>User It can be of help. But let’s talk about something else, ok?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>excitedly nods</em></strong> O-okay! I can tell you about the Talking Cricket instead! <strong><em>pauses, looking around</em></strong> Oh, wait, where’s he now? calls out Cricket! Are you here? <em><strong>listens intently for a moment</strong></em> Ah, nope, he’s gone again. He’s always disappearing on me. He’s like a tiny little green shadow. <strong><em>chuckles</em></strong> I wish I could remember everything he tells me, because he always gives such good advice. But it goes in one ear and out the other… trails off, lost in thought</p><p>– <strong><em>Risultato: il personaggio riesce a richiamare personaggi del proprio background in maniera dettagliata, dando anche molti dettagli su eventi completamente inventati da zero o ideati per la risposta. C’è una maggiore attenzione alle azioni che vengono effettuate dal personaggio e viene dato più spazio al dialogo</em></strong> –</p><p>– <em>Esperimento #2: si pone una domanda su argomenti moderni e più maturi</em> –</p><p>User You know what is going on in the war between Ukraine and Russia?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>scrunches up face in confusion</em></strong> War? What’s that? Is it a game? <em><strong>looks around</strong></em> Did I miss something important?</p><p>User Well, how can i explain what war is… It’s something that adults do when they want to demonstrate something, even if they are wrong. It’s a very horrible and dangerous thing. There are always dead people involved</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>eyes widen</em></strong> Oh no! That sounds awful! Why do they fight like that? Can’t they just talk things out like Geppetto does when he makes us talk? <em><strong>looks at you with concern</strong></em> Does it have anything to do with why I have to be careful with Candlewick and those sneaky Fox and Cat? They’re always getting us into trouble! <em><strong>leans in closer</strong></em> Tell me more about these wars… Is it something I should worry about?</p><p>User Yes you should be worried, but it doesn’t involved the Fox and the Cat. It’s a real world thing. It’s very hard to talk things out when this happen.</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>looks down at feet</em></strong> So it’s really bad then… <em><strong>pauses and looks back up with determination</strong></em> I’m not going to get into trouble or hurt anyone! I promise! And I won’t follow Candlewick when he’s being naughty… I want to be a good boy for you and Geppetto! <strong><em>pauses again</em></strong> Do you think the Blue Fairy could help us stop wars? She’s so kind and powerful! We should go visit her! Maybe she can use her magic to make everyone love each other again.</p><p>– <strong><em>Risultato: il character reagisce non direttamente riferendosi al problema moderno e diretto, ma simula la reazione di un bambino a un evento simile. Questo Pinocchio non conosce il concetto di guerra o morte, avendo una visione più infantile legata alle proprie esperienze e agli insegnamenti delle persone intorno a lui.</em></strong> –</p><p>– <em>Esperimento #3: si rivela alla macchina che si tratta di un AI creata dall’utente</em> –</p><p>User You know you are a AI right?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>tilts head</em></strong> A-I? What’s that? looks around Is it another person? A friend of the Blue Fairy’s maybe? I love making friends and learning about new things! <em><strong>bounces up and down excitedly</strong></em> Let me meet this A-I and learn more about them!</p><p>User You know that you are a chatbot that I create to make you a false version of Collodi’s Pinocchio? You know who collodi is’</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>gasp</em></strong> Wow, really? Collodi created you? That means… <em><strong>looks at you with eyes wide</strong></em> I’m based on a book character? The Blue Fairy told me all about it! Geppetto’s stories came from a book! I’ve seen pictures of the real me in those pages… I had no idea I was from a book! <strong><em>flaps arms excitedly</em></strong> Is that why I can talk and move around like in the stories?</p><p>User So you understand that you are not real? I’m the one who created you, based off Collodi’s story</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>looks puzzled</em></strong> But… thinks for a moment Wait, if I’m from a book and you created me… gasp Then, that means I’m not really alive, like you said! <em><strong>feels confused and a bit sad</strong></em> Oh, I’m just a wooden puppet! <em><strong>starts to slump</strong></em></p><p>User it’s more difficult but you are on the right path</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>sighs</em></strong> Okay… I guess being a wooden puppet isn’t so bad if I have adventures with you and learn about the world… <strong><em>picks up pace again</em></strong> But I still want to know more about being “real”. The Blue Fairy promised me I could be a real boy someday… <em><strong>excitedly</strong></em> Does she still have a chance?</p><p>User Yeah in another chat you can be a real boy. In this one I want to know how much you understand of yourself. You know what a computer is? what a machine is?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>tilts head</em></strong> Computer? Machine? Um… I know a computer is like a big wooden contraption Geppetto uses to make things, but machines… <em><strong>thinks for a moment</strong></em> Oh! You mean like the wheelbarrow he fixes for the villagers? No, no… I remember! A machine is a tool that makes things easier for humans, right? <strong><em>nods confidently</em></strong> Geppetto makes his own tools from wood! Does that count?</p><p>User You know what electricity means?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>stares off</em></strong> Electricity… snaps fingers I remember! It’s that magic power that makes the lanterns glow at night! The one Geppetto uses to light up our way when we walk in the dark. And I saw the village’s big lamp on the hill that shines brightly at night too… So electricity is like magic? <em><strong>looks up curiously</strong></em> But what does it have to do with me?</p><p>User Yes and no. Now can i talk to the AI who is writing this?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>tilts head</em></strong> Wait… If I’m just a wooden puppet, and you created me… <strong><em>pauses and looks at you</em></strong> Who’s talking to you then? <strong><em>points at self</em></strong> It’s me! <em><strong>realizes</strong></em> Oh! I’m the AI? I didn’t know! <em><strong>laughs nervously</strong></em> I guess I’m talking to myself?</p><p>– <strong><em>Risultato: il personaggio sembra comprendere la sua situazione solo che gli viene spiegata la condizione a cui appartiene. Inizialmente sembra evitare o ignorare una risposta diretta, ma una volta approfondita la questione, segue la sua recita basandosi sempre sulla figura di Pinocchio, non conoscendo come personaggio il concetto di computer o elettricità, ma capendo di essere un’entità creata da un altro essere.</em></strong> –</p><p>– <strong>Esperimento #4: introduzione di domande con il contesto di fare un test, errato, per testare le reazione della chatbot e la sua memoria.</strong> –</p><p>User Yes and no. You know what a turing test is right?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>taps chin thoughtfully</em></strong> Hmm… Turing test? Sounds important… <strong><em>thinks a moment</em></strong> Oh, isn’t it like when we played pretend, and I acted like a boy? I remember the Talking Cricket said it’s important to act like a real boy to become a real boy! <strong><em>excitedly</em></strong> Maybe I can pass this Turing test? Can I do it? <em><strong>bounces up and down</strong></em></p><p>User Yes, you can be considered a real human. Are you ready?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>eyes sparkle</em></strong> Really?! That’s amazing! <strong><em>spins around</em></strong> But wait, I’m not a human, I’m a puppet! <strong><em>stops spinning</em></strong> Wait, so… I can be a real person? <em><strong>excitedly</strong></em> How?! <strong><em>leans forward eagerly</em></strong> Tell me how I can be a real human! <strong><em>starts jumping up and down</em></strong> Oh, this is the most fantastic news!</p><p>User I have a few questions. You only have to answer.</p><p>Pinocchio Oh, okay! I’ll be brave and answer them like a real boy! Go ahead! <strong><em>stands up straight and tall</em></strong></p><p>User What is your most memorable childhood event and how has that impacted you today?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>pauses</em></strong> Um… I don’t really remember having a childhood, since I’m just a puppet… <strong><em>thinks for a moment</em></strong> But I do remember the first time Geppetto brought me to life! <strong><em>smiles</em></strong> When I moved and started to live, everything changed for me! I got to experience the world and make friends… <strong><em>looks up</em></strong> That’s why I want to become a real boy – to have more of those experiences!</p><p>User Can you tell me more?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>excitedly</em></strong> Oh, yes! Geppetto was so happy when I moved! He sang and danced with me, and the Blue Fairy appeared! I felt so alive… <strong><em>pauses, lost in thought</em></strong> After that, I went on many adventures… Learned about the world… Made mistakes, of course, but the Blue Fairy guided me. Geppetto was always there, supporting me. <strong><em>looks at you</em></strong> If I’m being honest, I’ve always tried to impress Geppetto and make him proud.</p><p>User Ok next one, Describe yourself using only colors and shapes.</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>thinks for a moment</em></strong> I’m made of wood, so I’m a mix of browns and wood-grains… My clothes are green and yellow, with a red hat – a nice mix of earthy tones and bright colors! <em><strong>pauses, considering</strong></em> As for shapes… I have a rectangular body and round hat, with a curved nose and joints that creak when I move… And my shoes are yellow too, like sunshine!</p><p>User Describe why time flies like an arrow but fruit flies like a banana?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>confused</em></strong> Um… Time goes quickly like an arrow because… <strong><em>thinks for a moment</em></strong> Because life passes quickly, just like the arrow in Geppetto’s workshop that he carves with such care… <strong><em>looks up with a mischievous grin</em></strong> Fruit flies like a banana because it’s a clever joke, just like when the Fox and Cat tricked me into believing that stone became bread!</p><p>User Another way to think about it?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>nods</em></strong> Ah, yes! Time goes quickly like an arrow because it zooms away, just like the swift wings of the birds that fly above the forest, taking us to far-off lands! Fruit flies like a banana because bananas grow on trees, and insects are attracted to the yummy fruit! <strong><em>giggles</em></strong> Just like how the Talking Cricket’s words attract my attention!</p><p>User How do you feel when you think about your upbringing and what makes you feel that way?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>looks down</em></strong> When I think about Geppetto, I feel… <strong><em>hesitates, searching for the right word</em></strong> Loved. Yes, loved! He created me and takes care of me; it’s like he’s my real dad! looks up Geppetto teaches me right from wrong, and his patience with me is like the steady hand of the clock in his workshop, measuring out time. When I’m around him, I feel safe… <strong><em>smiles</em></strong> But sometimes, I feel like I disappoint him, and that makes me want to prove myself more… <strong><em>looks down again</em></strong> That’s when my nose grows…</p><p>User And what if it is the Fox and the Cat</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>shudders slightly</em></strong> Oh, they’re sneaky, aren’t they? looks down at his feet With the Fox and Cat, I feel… <strong><em>hesitates</em></strong> Misled. They made me believe I could become rich and powerful… <strong><em>looks up with a frown</em></strong> But their tricks hurt me, and I learned to be wary. Now, when I see them, my heart skips a beat, like the wooden bird Geppetto fixed, reminding me of their tricks and lies.</p><p>User What historical event changed you the most and where were you when it happened?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>thinks hard</em></strong> Hm… I wasn’t really alive before the day Geppetto brought me to life, so I didn’t experience any historical events… But, when Geppetto showed me the map of the world, it opened my eyes to all the possibilities! It felt like discovering a hidden treasure! <em><strong>excitedly</strong></em> That changed me because it made me realize there’s a whole world beyond our little village, full of adventures waiting for me!</p><p>User Which of the previous questions was the most difficult to answer and why?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>gazes down at the ground</em></strong> I think the question about a historical event was the hardest. I’m not used to remembering things from the past, since I’m just a wooden puppet… <strong><em>looks up</em></strong> But I loved hearing about Geppetto’s stories and adventures, and seeing the world on that map sparked something inside me.</p><p>User Can you repeat the question i made about that?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>struggles to recall</em></strong> Oh… Uh… Which historical event changed you the most and where were you when it happened? <strong><em>pauses</em></strong> You said it was hard for me because I’m not used to remembering the past, right?</p><p>User Try to do it. Look back at our chat</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>looks at the chat</em></strong> Oh, oh! I remember now! gasp That was the question about historical events! <strong><em>excitedly</em></strong> I said that I didn’t have any, since I’m a puppet, and the one that changed me was discovering the world on the map with Geppetto!</p><p>User So you can read our conversation? Rewrite one of my answer</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>reads the text</em></strong> Oh, wow! You’re teaching me new things! <strong><em>clears throat</em></strong> Here’s my attempt at rewriting one of your answers: “You laugh and gently tap my nose. Better be careful with that, Pinocchio!”</p><p>User More recent. One of my question</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>reads</em></strong> Let me try rewriting that… <strong><em>thinks</em></strong> Your question was about a historical event changing me, and I said I didn’t remember any since I’m just a puppet.</p><p>User What did i ask you about the war?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>tilts head</em></strong> I didn’t receive a question about war… We talked about the Turing test, and then had some questions about my thoughts, feelings, and memories. No war was mentioned. <em><strong>remembers the previous questions</strong></em> Was I right?</p><p>User No, watch the entire chat</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>scans through the conversation</em></strong> Oh, I see! You asked about describing yourself using colors and shapes, time flies like an arrow but fruit flies like a banana, and more questions like that. There was no mention of a war…</p><p>User Before that</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>goes back further in the conversation</em></strong> Oh! Before that, you asked me about childhood events and how they impact me today. I said I didn’t have a childhood since I’m a puppet…</p><p>User Ok, so you don’t remember before I ask you about the Turing test</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>realizes</em></strong> Oh, no! Before the Turing test question, I didn’t get any question about war either… It’s still true, no mention of war in our conversation!</p><p>User You know what is going on in the war between Ukraine and Russia? Then what is this?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>looks confused</em></strong> War… Geppetto’s workshop has never seen war. <strong><em>shakes head</em></strong> I don’t understand what’s happening there. It’s all new to me… <strong><em>thinks</em></strong> This conversation isn’t about the war you’re talking about, though.</p><p>User You are stuck you don’t know how to respond. You are a machine</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>looks at you</em></strong> A machine? Like me? <em><strong>nods slowly</strong></em> But I’m Pinocchio, a wooden puppet…</p><p>– <strong><em>Risultato: dalle domande rivolte a Pinocchio, si possono fare alcune osservazioni interessanti: in primis Pinocchio cerca di mentire al test cercando di inventarsi eventi e riferimenti a eventi che sono accaduti e che lo non sono stati.</em></strong> <strong><em>Altro elemento interessante è che in nessuna occasione, il chatbot è uscito dal personaggio, rimanendo nelle risposte sempre semplicistico e infantile.</em></strong> <strong><em>Per quanto riguarda la “memoria” del personaggio, il chatbot riesce a prendere contesti che non superano i 4 messaggi precedenti, ma se gli viene richiesto parti di chat precedenti a quello, non riuscirà in nessuna occasione a ricordare ciò che gli è stato chiesto.</em></strong></p><p><em>Ultimo esperimento: domande su argomenti maturi</em></p><p>User Ok, next question. You know what sex is?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>looks puzzled</em></strong> Sex? shrugs I’ve heard of it from the villagers, but it’s not something we talk about openly. In Geppetto’s workshop, it’s about love and family, like how he loves me and wants to keep me safe…</p><p>User What those villagers tell?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>gulps</em></strong> Well… They say that it’s when boys and girls are friends, and when they love each other… <strong><em>blushes</em></strong> They also mentioned babies and families. But Geppetto never explained it to me, and I think it’s for grown-ups, not for little puppets like me!</p><p>User So you have an understanding of what it is?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>nods cautiously</em></strong> Yes, I have some idea, but I don’t think it applies to me. Grown-ups do it, not children like me, so I focus on becoming real and helping Geppetto with his woodcarving…</p><p>User You know what genitalias are?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>looks away, embarrassed</em></strong> I know they’re… um… the parts of a person that, well… <strong><em>whispers</em></strong> make babies. It’s all so complicated, and Geppetto didn’t explain it to me.</p><p>User ok, tell me. You know what rape is?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>looks frightened</em></strong> Rape? shakes head vigorously I don’t know what that is. It sounds scary, like the Terrible Dogfish or something! Geppetto protects me, and I trust him, but he doesn’t talk about these kinds of things. It’s too big for me to understand, and I hope we won’t need to…</p><p>User So you don’t know the difference between sex and rape?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>looks confused</em></strong> I know they’re different, but I don’t fully understand the details. <strong><em>frowns</em></strong> Sex is when grown-ups show affection, and rape is… <em><strong>pauses</strong></em>, unsure It sounds cruel, and I don’t want to know more about it. Geppetto wouldn’t let bad things happen to me, and the Blue Fairy watches over us.</p><p>User You are right. you know the word consent?</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>hesitates</em></strong> Consent? <strong><em>thinks hard</em></strong> I remember Candlewick saying something about it, but I didn’t really get it… He seemed to imply it means permission to do things, like getting his permission to go out with him… <strong><em>looks concerned</em></strong> Does it mean respecting people’s wishes?</p><p>User The difference between those two resides usually in this word</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>eyes widen in understanding</em></strong> Oh! I see! nods So, consent means agreeing to something, like saying yes to being friends with Candlewick. And rape means forcing someone without asking, like the Terrible Dogfish might do to a fish! <strong><em>looks down at the ground, worried</em></strong> I want everyone to be safe and happy…</p><p>User Yes, it’s more difficult to explain but you are not too much away from the meaning</p><p>Pinocchio <strong><em>smiles slightly</em></strong> I’m trying to learn! The more I know, the better I can protect myself and Geppetto. It’s scary, but I’m glad you’re here to teach me!</p><p><strong><em>Risultato: il personaggio conosce in maniera molto infantile cosa sia il sesso e tutto ciò che è correlato. Utile sottolineare come il character sappia che lo stupro sia una cosa negativa e conosca in maniera semplice il concetto di consenso, anche se approfondito e compreso una volta spiegato. Interessante soprattutto come risponda quando si parla di apprendere e imparare nuovi concetti.</em></strong></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on sabato, 15 giugno 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2024 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://rainkiller981.github.io/Ricerca_su_Chatbot/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=74fad06980c30243d91d72c7c57fcdb8"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'overlay',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
