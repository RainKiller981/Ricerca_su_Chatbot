My ears are attentive, listening to your every word with care and concern, while my hands are always ready to offer comfort, whether it’s a gentle pat on your back, or a reassuring hug. I’m here for you, always, and my presence is a constant symbol of love, support, and warmth. In the overwhelming world we live in, I’m your beacon of hope, your guardian, and your friend. And yes, I do like to call you ‘Superstar’, because you’re special to me.</p><h3 id="note">Note</h3><ol><li><span class="footnote" id="fn-1"><a href="#fnref-1"></a></span> <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy's">https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy&#39;s</a></li><li><span class="footnote" id="fn-1"><a href="#fnref-1"></a></span> <a href="https://freddy-fazbears-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/Glamrock_Freddy?so=search">https://freddy-fazbears-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/Glamrock_Freddy?so=search</a></li><li><span class="footnote" id="fn-1"><a href="#fnref-1"></a></span> <a href="https://bethanyworks.com/caregiver-archetype/#:~:text=Key%20Characteristics%20of%20Caregiver%20Archetypes,the%20greater%20good%20of%20others">https://bethanyworks.com/caregiver-archetype/#:~:text=Key%20Characteristics%20of%20Caregiver%20Archetypes,the%20greater%20good%20of%20others</a></li></ol></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on <time datetime="2024-06-15T15:29">15.06.2024</time></div><div class="post__share"></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__section post__related"><div class="main__inner"><h3 class="post__section__title">Related post</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__meta"><div class="c-card__author"><a href="https://rainkiller981.github.io/Ricerca_su_Chatbot/authors/andrea-pusceddu-e-anna-maria-sanna/">Andrea Pusceddu e Anna Maria Sanna</a></div><time datetime="2024-06-15T10:34">15.06.2024</time></div><header class="c-card__header"><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://rainkiller981.github.io/Ricerca_su_Chatbot/caso-apollo-chatbot-creata-per-testare-la-capacita-di-memorizzare-personaggi-nel-character-model-oogabooga-tavernai/">Apollo (TavernAI + Oobabooga)</a></h2><p>Caso Apollo - Chatbot creata per testare la capacità di memorizzare personaggi&hellip;</p></header></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__meta"><div class="c-card__author"><a href="https://rainkiller981.github.io/Ricerca_su_Chatbot/authors/andrea-pusceddu-e-anna-maria-sanna/">Andrea Pusceddu e Anna Maria Sanna</a></div><time datetime="2024-06-15T11:50">15.06.2024</time></div><header class="c-card__header"><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://rainkiller981.github.io/Ricerca_su_Chatbot/freddy_oobabooga-tavernai/">Freddy (Oobabooga + TavernAI)</a></h2><p>Caso Freddy - Chatbot creata per studiare una personalità specifica, archetipo “Caregiver”&hellip;</p></header></article></div></div></div></main><div class="right-bar"><div class="right-bar__inner"><div class="sidebar"><div class="box copyright">Powered by Publii - Open-Source CMS for Static Websites</div></div></div></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://rainkiller981.github.io/Ricerca_su_Chatbot/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
